Creating your own platform similar to Spark AR is an ambitious but achievable project. Here’s a roadmap to help you get started:

### 1. **Conceptualize the Platform**

Define the key features and functionalities your platform will offer. For instance:

- **Filter Creation Tools**: Drag-and-drop interface, 3D object import, texture editing.
- **AI Integration**: Pre-trained AI models, real-time processing.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Filters should work on Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat, and potentially other platforms.
- **NFT Minting**: Directly mint filters as NFTs on platforms like OKX.

### 2. **Technical Stack**

#### a. **Frontend Development**

- **Frameworks**: React.js or Vue.js for a dynamic, responsive UI.
- **Rendering**: Three.js for 3D rendering and AR capabilities.

#### b. **Backend Development**

- **Server**: Node.js with Express.js.
- **Database**: MongoDB for storing user data, filter configurations, and NFTs.
- **Storage**: AWS S3 or another cloud storage solution for storing large assets.

#### c. **AI Integration**

- **Framework**: TensorFlow.js or PyTorch for deploying AI models.
- **Real-Time Processing**: WebAssembly (Wasm) for performance-critical operations.

#### d. **Blockchain Integration**

- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity for Ethereum-based NFTs.
- **Platform**: OKX or other Ethereum-compatible blockchain platforms.
- **Wallet Integration**: MetaMask or other web3 wallets.

### 3. **Development Phases**

#### a. **Phase 1: Core Features**

1. **User Authentication**
   - Sign up, login, and authentication using JWT.

2. **Filter Creation Interface**
   - Implement a basic drag-and-drop interface using Three.js.
   - Allow users to upload and manipulate 3D objects and textures.

3. **AI Model Integration**
   - Add pre-trained models for basic AR effects (e.g., facial recognition, object tracking).

#### b. **Phase 2: Advanced Features**

1. **Advanced Editing Tools**
   - Add more complex editing tools for creating detailed filters.

2. **Real-Time Preview**
   - Implement a real-time preview feature using WebGL and Three.js.

#### c. **Phase 3: NFT Integration**

1. **NFT Minting**
   - Integrate a feature to mint filters as NFTs using the OKX API.
   - Implement smart contracts to manage ownership and royalties.

2. **Marketplace**
   - Develop a marketplace where users can buy and sell filters.

3. **Payment Integration**
   - Integrate cryptocurrency payments for purchasing NFTs.

### 4. **Deployment and Testing**

- **Staging Environment**: Set up a staging environment for testing.
- **User Testing**: Conduct beta testing with a small group of users.
- **Bug Fixes**: Address any issues discovered during testing.

### 5. **Launch and Marketing**

- **Soft Launch**: Initially launch the platform to a limited audience.
- **Feedback Loop**: Collect feedback and make necessary improvements.
- **Marketing Campaign**: Launch a marketing campaign to attract more users.

### Example Setup for a Basic Filter Creation Interface

Here’s a simple example using Three.js to get you started:

#### HTML

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Filter Creation Interface</title>
  <style>
    body { margin: 0; }
    canvas { display: block; }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <div id="container"></div>
  <script type="module" src="main.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

#### JavaScript (main.js)

```javascript
import * as THREE from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/three@0.142.0';

let scene, camera, renderer;

function init() {
  // Scene
  scene = new THREE.Scene();
  scene.background = new THREE.Color(0x000000);

  // Camera
  camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(75, window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight, 0.1, 1000);
  camera.position.z = 5;

  // Renderer
  renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer();
  renderer.setSize(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight);
  document.getElementById('container').appendChild(renderer.domElement);

  // Cube
  const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry();
  const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0x00ff00 });
  const cube = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);
  scene.add(cube);

  // Animation
  function animate() {
    requestAnimationFrame(animate);
    cube.rotation.x += 0.01;
    cube.rotation.y += 0.01;
    renderer.render(scene, camera);
  }
  animate();
}

init();
```

You can test and expand this code to build more complex features.

# SolanaKotlinComposeScaffold

A boilerplate example app for Solana Mobile dApps built using Jetpack Compose.
It provides an interface to connect to locally installed wallet apps (that are MWA-compatible), view your account balance on devnet, and request an airdrop of SOL.

## Featured Libarires

- [Mobile Wallet Adapter (`clientlib-ktx`)](https://github.com/solana-mobile/mobile-wallet-adapter/tree/main/js/packages/mobile-wallet-adapter-protocol) for connecting to wallets and signing transactions/messages
- [web3-solana](https://github.com/solana-mobile/web3-core) for Solana primitive types (`SolanaPublicKey`) and constructing messages/transactions.
- [rpc-core](https://github.com/solana-mobile/rpc-core) for constructing and sending [Solana RPC requests](https://docs.solana.com/api/http).

## Prerequisites

You'll need to first setup your environment for Android development. Follow the [Prerequisite Setup Guide](https://docs.solanamobile.com/getting-started/development-setup).

Follow the guide to make sure you:

- setup your Android and React Native development environment.
- have an Android device or emulator.
- install an MWA compliant wallet app on your device/emulator.

## Usage

1. Initialize project template

```bash
git clone https://github.com/solana-mobile/solana-kotlin-compose-scaffold.git
```

2. Open the project on Android Studio > Open > "SolanaKotlinComposeScaffold/app/build.gradle.kts"

3. Start your emulator/device and build the app

## Troubleshooting

- `Compatible wallet not found.`
  - Make sure you install a compatible MWA wallet on your device, like Phantom, Solflare, Ultimate, or `fakewallet`. Follow
    the [setup guide](https://docs.solanamobile.com/getting-started/development-setup).
That sounds like an innovative project! Here's a step-by-step guide on how to achieve this:

### 1. **Create Advanced AI Filters**

You need to develop AI filters first. Tools and platforms to create such filters include:

- **Spark AR**: For Facebook and Instagram.
- **Lens Studio**: For Snapchat.

These platforms provide a robust set of tools for developing advanced AR filters.

### 2. **Integrate AI Models**

To make your filters more advanced, you can integrate machine learning models using libraries like TensorFlow.js or MediaPipe. You might need to export your models and integrate them into the AR platforms.

### 3. **Minting Filters as NFTs**

For minting your filters as NFTs on the blockchain, you can use platforms like OKX. Here's a general process:

#### a. **Prepare Your Digital Assets**

Export your filters and related files in a format that can be minted. Common formats include images, videos, or 3D models.

#### b. **Select an NFT Marketplace**

Choose an NFT marketplace that supports the OKX blockchain, such as OKX NFT Marketplace. Register and create a wallet if you don't already have one.

#### c. **Minting Process**

1. **Upload your Filter Assets**: Upload the assets you prepared.
2. **Metadata**: Provide metadata for your NFT. This includes the name, description, and any attributes of your filter.
3. **Mint**: Mint the NFT by following the platform’s process, which typically involves signing a transaction with your wallet.

### 4. **Deploy and Distribute Filters**

Once minted, distribute your filters across the platforms (Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat). You can share the filter links and NFT ownership details on these platforms to attract users.

### 5. **Start Free, Then Monetize**

Initially, offer your filters for free to build a user base. Once you gain traction, start charging for premium filters. Use the NFT smart contracts to manage ownership and royalties.

### Platform and Tools Summary

- **AR Filter Creation**: Spark AR (Instagram, Facebook), Lens Studio (Snapchat)
- **AI Integration**: TensorFlow.js, MediaPipe
- **Blockchain & NFT**: OKX NFT Marketplace
